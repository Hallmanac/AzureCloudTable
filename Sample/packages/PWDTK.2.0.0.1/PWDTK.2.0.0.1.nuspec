    <description>PWDTK.NET (Password Toolkit) is a .NET API which easily allows you to create crypto random salt and generate password hashes using a HMAC-SHA512 based version of the PBKDF2 specification. It also contains an implementation of password policies which are enforced using regular expressions.</description>
    <summary>Supports .NET 4.5, .NET 4, .NET 4 Client, .NET 3.5, .NET 3.5 Client</summary>
    <releaseNotes>Added Max Password size of 1024 Bytes to stop a DOS attack happening from an attacker forcing big passwords to hash taking a long time and slowing the server down! This is due to this security article https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/sep/15/security/ whilst the user should enforce max password size on client side, I implemented a PasswordTooLong Exception which will be thrown if you don't stop passwords bigger than 1024 bytes client side!</releaseNotes>
